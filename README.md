### Slater is an alternative software concept, where all human-computer interaction is message-based, and all logic is developed lazily, over time, in response to real user stories.

Its name refers to the idea that for every use case, it offers a `clean slate`.

When ready, it will be a secure and private peer to peer messaging app, web browser, and environment for "Wizard of Oz" style software development. Wizard of Oz means that you basically *pretend to be* the software in order to learn its requirements from real user interaction. To facilitate this style of development, Slater offers a rich set of message types containing graphical elements. When an user interacts with these elements, they emit another message containing the resulting value. [A simple scripting language](https://github.com/d5/tengo) is embedded for adding listeners for these messages, which can then perform some logic and send another message.

What *Typeform is for forms,* Slater will be *for software in general*. It will enable the easiest and most efficient form of software development ever seen, and will be offered as the most cost-effective software consulting option available. It will democratize the power of custom software, enable an explosion of new applications and services, and employ a legion of happy developers who will simply sprinkle bits of code onto chats to automate user stories more and more over time, like *Uber for software*.
